Now the app is ready to be used. It app can be installed on an android mobile device. 

The first activity contains two buttons, one is the photo button and the other is the slideshow button. On the start of the app, a URL retrives a list of photo urls. Once its all downloaded, clicking on the photo button starts the photo activity. Tapping the slide show button starts the photo activity in the slide show mode.
Clicking the photo button starts the photo activity where the photos can be viewed by swiping the photos. Swiping from right to left displays a new photo while swiping from left to right displays the previous photo. A disk cache has also been implemented to cache downloaded photos.
